## Description

Pairs is a game where a set of playing cards or tiles are shuffled and placed face-down on a surface. 

The objective is to find matching pairs of cards by flipping them over two at a time. When a player selects two cards that match, they are shown on the playing area.
If the cards don't match, they are flipped back face-down, and the player's turn ends. The game continues until all pairs have been found and removed.

The challenge in Pairs is to remember the position of previously revealed cards to make successful matches. 
It tests players' memory and concentration skills, as they try to remember the locations of various cards to improve their chances of finding matching pairs.
